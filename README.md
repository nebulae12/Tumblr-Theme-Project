# Tumblr-Theme-Project

This is in partial fulfillment of the requirements for Code Louisville, May 2017 Front End Web Development.

I created a Tumblr theme since I have always wanted to customize my own Tumblr blog.

Tumblr is a social media platform on which users can host their blogs. Themes are available for users to choose for their blogs, which at a minimum display posts, and optionally display a header, tags, timestamp, previous and next pages, other user-generated pages (like an About page), and more.
The Tumblr documentation for creating a theme is located here: https://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/custom_themes.

Please note the html (nebulous_markup.html) cannot display anything without being hooked up to a Tumblr blog.

Try grading this by visiting http://nebulae12.tumblr.com. Let me know if you need to get on the user's side, and I can get you the login and password. You may want this to understand the "theme assets" which to Tumblr are all the files that are NOT the html file, including the header image, scroll back up button image, external CSS stylesheet, and JS file. Thanks!
